I'm an engineering manager at RTL, where I work in the Content Supply Chain & Advertisement domains. I'm passionate about software engineering and AI.

I spend a lot of time thinking about how to make teams more effective, how to build better software, and how AI can help us work smarter. I believe in writing code that's maintainable, in building systems that scale, and in creating environments where people can do their best work.

When I'm not working, you'll find me at home with my wife and daughter, or out exploring somewhere with them. I love being in nature.

## What I'm Learning

The AI space moves fast, and I'm always trying to keep up. I'm particularly interested in how AI can improve developer productivity and how we can build AI-powered tools that actually help rather than just being cool demos.
